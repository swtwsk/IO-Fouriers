# Fourier's Phone

Are you tired of using Messenger, What's up or other mainstream communication apps?
Do you feel like you need to try something different than all other things?
Then, the Fourier's phone is just for you!

## How does it work?
Fourier's phone is an innovative mobile app that allows two smartphones to communicate
using just audible sounds. Type in a message in one phone and click the "SEND" button.
The message will be translated into a sequence of audible sounds of different frequency.
The other smartphone can start receiving the message - collecting the sounds and translating
them back into the original message.
